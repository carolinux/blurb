I'm flying down to Los Angeles
on business,

on her first airplane.

I thought if babies were on the plane,
the plane couldn't crash.

something I didn't.

they close the doors

heard anybody scream

Come on.

I used to work
at a smorgasbord,

736
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,166

would flock there,
and they loved to eat.

737

They'd just jam their mouths,
you know? They just would
eat with their mouths open.

738
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,880
To be honest,
it’s just too much for me.

739

you get to be thinking
about how short life is...

and how maybe-
maybe everything
has no meaning.

741

Because you wake up,
and then you're
frying burgers,

and then you're, like,
60 and 70, and then,
you know, you check out.

I just don't need to think
about those kinds of things.
