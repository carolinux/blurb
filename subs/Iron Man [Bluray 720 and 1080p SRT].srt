1
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,978

I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

2
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:21,079

This is crazy. What did I do?

3
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,623

I feel like you're going to 
pull over and snuff me.

4
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:25,125

What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

5
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:26,422

We can talk, sir.

6
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:30,295

- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

7
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,562

Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't 
have called that.

8
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:36,103

I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't 
that what we're going for here?

9
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:38,969

- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

10
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,804

You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,674

I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:46,543

Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh.

13
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:49,451

- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

14
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:53,215

Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

15
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,449

That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:56,991

March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:59,994

but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:02,963

Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:06,899

- Is it cool if I take 
a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,837

All right.

21
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:14,034

I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:15,701

Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:17,369

No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,449

Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,586

Come on. Hurry up.
Just click it. 
Don't change any settings.

26
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:32,251

- What's going on?
- Contact left!

27
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,022

What have we got?

28
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:37,356

Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,490

- Stay down!
- Yeah.

30
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,364

Son of a bitch!

31
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:50,842

- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

32
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:21,440

Whoa!

33
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,188

Tony Stark.

34
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:16,129

Visionary. Genius.

35
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,864

American patriot.

36
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,094

Even from an early age,

37
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:22,636

the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

38
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:26,265

quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

39
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,811

At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

40
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:32,039

At age six, his first engine.

41
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:36,550

And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

42
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,919

Then, the passing of a titan.

43
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:44,424

Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

44
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:47,928

steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

45
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:51,463

until, at age 21, the 
prodigal son returns

46
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,934

and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

47
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:56,368

With the keys to the kingdom,

48
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:59,236

Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

49
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:03,368

creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, 
satellite targeting.

50
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,313

Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

51
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,214

by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

52
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,844

and her interests around the globe.

53
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,528

As liaison to Stark Industries,

54
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,863

I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

55
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,699

He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

56
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,403

Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

57
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,776

to present this year's Apogee 
Award to Mr. Tony Stark.

58
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,317

Tony?

59
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:02,195

- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

60
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:05,967

This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

61
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,508

This is wonderful.

62
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,379

Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

63
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:18,379

But if I were Tony, I would 
tell you how honored I feel

64
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:23,453

and what a joy it is to receive 
this very prestigious award.

65
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,325

Tony, you know...

66
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,329

The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

67
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,796

He's always working.

68
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,302

Work it! Come on!

69
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:43,401

- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

70
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:46,777

- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

71
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:47,849

- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

72
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,817

if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

73
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,785

Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

74
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:54,583

- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

75
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,525

- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

76
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:56,820

- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

77
00:06:56,926 --> 00:06:58,257

- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

78
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,658

Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

79
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:02,321

I don't have any of those
floating around.

80
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:04,490

We're gonna let it ride!

81
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,727

Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

82
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:08,929

Okay, you, too.

83
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:10,903

- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

84
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,497

There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

85
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:14,837

Two craps. Line away.

86
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:16,741

- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

87
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:18,245

I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, William.

88
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:19,803

- This is where I exit.
- All right.

89
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:20,882

Tomorrow, don't be late.

90
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,211

- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

91
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,580

I know, I know.

92
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:27,178

Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

93
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,858

Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

94
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,460

Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

95
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:37,623

Can I ask you a couple of questions?

96
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,200

- She's cute.
- She's all right?

97
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,335

- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:42,370

- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

99
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:44,268

You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

100
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:47,206

- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

101
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:48,867

And what do you say
to your other nickname?

102
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,138

"The Merchant of Death"?

103
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,736

That's not bad.

104
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:55,646

- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

105
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,284

Well, Ms. Brown,

106
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:00,822

it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

107
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:03,619

I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

108
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,887

I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

109
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:07,019

Rehearse that much?

110
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:08,790

Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

111
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:11,230

- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

112
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,563

All I want is a serious answer.

113
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,864

Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

114
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:18,371

"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

115
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:20,738

That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

116
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:23,607

My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

117
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,272

A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

118
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:27,542

would call that being a hero.

119
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,811

And a lot of people would also 
call that war profiteering.

120
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,046

Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

121
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:33,883

by advancing medical technology

122
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:36,321

or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

123
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:39,656

All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

124
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:43,162

You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

125
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,130

I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

126
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:01,008

Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

127
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:04,745

The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

128
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:08,252

The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

129
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,791

High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

130
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:29,105

Tony?

131
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:31,877

Hey, Tony?

132
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:55,933

You are not authorized
to access this area.

133
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:58,767

- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

134
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,902

I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

135
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,740

and there's a car waiting for you outside

136
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:06,110

that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

137
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:09,940

- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

138
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:15,455

After all these years, Tony still 
has you picking up the dry-cleaning.

139
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:18,890

I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

140
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,758

including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

141
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:22,922

Will that be all?

142
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:41,473

Give me an exploded view.

143
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,814

The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.

144
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,448

Log that.

145
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:52,284

- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

146
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:53,383

I'll keep you posted.

147
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:55,224

You are supposed to be halfway 
around the world right now.

148
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,662

- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

149
00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:59,298

Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

150
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,096

Your flight was scheduled to 
leave an hour and a half ago.

151
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,296

That's funny, I thought with 
it being my plane and all,

152
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:04,929

that it would just wait for me
to get there.

153
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,769

Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

154
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,933

before I get you out of the door.

155
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,273

Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

156
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,573

if it departs before you arrive?

157
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,013

Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

158
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:16,709

Do you want it? Yes or no.

159
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:18,878

Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

160
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,189

No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

161
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,519

where he lived and worked,

162
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,115

- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

163
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:29,561

I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

164
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:33,026

I need it. Buy it. Store it.

165
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:36,362

Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

166
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:39,270

Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

167
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:41,774

They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

168
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:43,344

Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

169
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:44,776

I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

170
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,780

What are you trying 
to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

171
00:11:46,882 --> 00:11:49,373

- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

172
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:51,510

I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

173
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,110

- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

174
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:54,655

I knew that. Already?

175
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,283

Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

176
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:01,788

- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

177
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:04,331

- And?
- It was very nice.

178
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,834

- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

179
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,629

You're welcome, Miss Potts.

180
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:14,809

Okay.

181
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:36,789

You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

182
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,368

You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

183
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:42,999

I got you. I got you.

184
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,537

What's wrong with you?

185
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,130

- What?
- Three hours.

186
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,368

I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

187
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,445

For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

188
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:53,037

Waiting on you now. 
Let's go. Come on.

189
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,683

Wheels up! Rock and roll!

190
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,319

- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

191
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,623

Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

192
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,426

I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

193
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:12,966

- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

194
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:14,194

You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

195
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:15,292

Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

196
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:16,769

- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

197
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:18,066

You don't respect yourself,

198
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,504

- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

199
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:20,939

I'm just your babysitter.

200
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:23,534

So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

201
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,806

Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

202
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:27,541

Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

203
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,014

- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

204
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:30,846

We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

205
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:33,353

- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

206
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:35,047

incapable of being responsible.

207
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:37,648

It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

208
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,783

Hot sake?

209
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:42,193

- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

210
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:43,628

That's what I'm talking about.

211
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:46,758

When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

212
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,597

you know what I recognize?

213
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:53,607

I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

214
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,704

Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

215
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:59,872

No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

216
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:01,813

Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

217
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:04,943

No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

218
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,637

General.

219
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:26,299

Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

220
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,375

Thanks.

221
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:32,178

Is it better to be feared or respected?

222
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:35,407

I say, is it too much to ask for both?

223
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:39,286

With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

224
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:41,151

of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

225
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,280

It's the first missile system

226
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:45,224

to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

227
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:49,263

They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

228
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,332

I respectfully disagree.

229
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:55,426

I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

230
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:58,900

That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

231
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,801

And it's worked out pretty well so far.

232
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,240

Find an excuse

233
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:06,644

to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

234
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:10,240

the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

235
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,501

For your consideration, the Jericho.

236
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,119

I'll be throwing one of these in

237
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,211

with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

238
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,311

To peace!

239
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,117

- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

240
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:54,695

I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?

241
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:56,593

It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

242
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:00,566

Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

243
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,102

Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

244
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:03,762

Good night, Tony.

245
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,641

- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

246
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:09,677

The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

247
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:12,474

- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

248
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:21,608

I wouldn't do that if I were you.

249
00:17:58,253 --> 00:17:59,982

What the hell did you do to me?

250
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:02,346

What I did?

251
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:05,421

What I did is to save your life.

252
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:09,323

I removed all the shrapnel 
I could, but there's a lot left,

253
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:11,194

and it's headed into your atrial septum.

254
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,696

Here, want to see?

255
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:17,200

I have a souvenir. Take a look.

256
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,103

I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

257
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,610

We call them the walking dead

258
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:27,876

because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

259
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,747

- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

260
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,646

hooked up to a car battery,

261
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:36,656

and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

262
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,992

That's right. Smile.

263
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:52,833

We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

264
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:55,899

- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

265
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:59,337

If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

266
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:02,610

much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

267
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,014

Where are we?

268
00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:07,852

Come on, stand up. Stand up!

269
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,848

Just do as I do.

270
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,619

Come on, put your hands up.

271
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:16,830

Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

272
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:19,298

Do you understand me? Do as I do.

273
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:43,986

He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

274
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:45,889

"in the history of America."

275
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:50,854

He is honored.

276
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:55,131

He wants you to build the missile.

277
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,869

The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

278
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:03,603

This one.

279
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:09,684

I refuse.

280
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:21,429

Tony!

281
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,777

He wants to know what you think.

282
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:16,546

I think you got a lot of my weapons.

283
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,656

He says they have everything you 
need to build the Jericho missile.

284
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,390

He wants you to make
the list of materials.

285
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,264

He says for you
to start working immediately,

286
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:41,604

and when you're done,
he will set you free.

287
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:47,638

- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

288
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:03,822

I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

289
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:06,992

But they will never find you
in these mountains.

290
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,367

Look, what you just saw,

291
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,267

that is your legacy, Stark.

292
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:20,278

Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

293
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,645

Is that how you want to go out?

294
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:28,155

Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

295
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,448

Or are you going to
do something about it?

296
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,655

Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, 
you, either way.

297
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:38,995

And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

298
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,431

Well, then,

299
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,129

this is a very important 
week for you, isn't it?

300
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:50,433

If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

301
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,737

I need welding gear. I don't 
care if it's acetylene or propane.

302
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:56,009

I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

303
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:59,109

I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

304
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,934

- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

305
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:17,732

But apparently,
not enough for this place.

306
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,864

They speak Arabic, Urdu,

307
00:23:19,974 --> 00:23:23,341

Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

308
00:23:24,546 --> 00:23:28,812

- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

309
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,508

They call themselves the Ten Rings.

310
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,395

You know, we might be more productive

311
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:45,261

if you include me
in the planning process.

312
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:56,072

Okay, we don't need this.

313
00:23:58,046 --> 00:23:59,479

What is that?

314
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:03,313

That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

315
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:07,386

We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

316
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:26,907

Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

317
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,670

Relax. I have steady hands.

318
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,169

Why do you think you're still alive?

319
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:42,820

- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

320
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,724

Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

321
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:48,459

Nice to meet you, too.

322
00:25:28,536 --> 00:25:30,800

That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

323
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:34,335

That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

324
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:37,473

I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

325
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:40,542

It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

326
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:42,309

But what could it generate?

327
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:46,945

If my math is right, and it always is,
three giga-joules per second.

328
00:25:47,455 --> 00:25:49,923

That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

329
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:53,050

Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

330
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,403

- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

331
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,465

Flatten them out and look.

332
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,046

Oh, wow.

333
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:16,707

Impressive.

334
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,710

Good.

335
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,440

Good roll. Good roll.

336
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:50,113

You still haven't told me
where you're from.

337
00:26:50,218 --> 00:26:53,016

I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

338
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:56,557

- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

339
00:26:56,924 --> 00:27:01,258

Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

340
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:03,654

And you, Stark?

341
00:27:07,802 --> 00:27:09,963

- No.
- No?

342
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:14,331

So you're a man who has everything

343
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:16,407

and nothing.

344
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:56,002

Relax.

345
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,314

The bow and arrow

346
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:10,254

once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

347
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,226

It allowed the great Genghis Khan

348
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:19,032

to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

349
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:23,331

An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

350
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:28,031

and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

351
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:33,009

But today,

352
00:29:33,881 --> 00:29:37,248

whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

353
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,150

rules these lands.

354
00:29:42,523 --> 00:29:43,854

And soon,

355
00:29:46,861 --> 00:29:48,556

it will be my turn.

356
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,203

What does he want?

357
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:59,131

What do you want? A delivery date?

358
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,771

I need him.

359
00:31:09,944 --> 00:31:11,434

Good assistant.

360
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:20,243

You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

361
00:32:25,052 --> 00:32:27,418

Okay? Can you move?

362
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:29,752

Okay, say it again.

363
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:32,348

41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

364
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,896

that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

365
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:06,625

Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

366
00:33:07,128 --> 00:33:08,755

Say something.
Say something back to him.

367
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:11,195

- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

368
00:33:11,298 --> 00:33:13,766

- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

369
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:39,184

- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

370
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:41,219

- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

371
00:33:41,328 --> 00:33:43,922

- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

372
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,298

Okay.

373
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,594

- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

374
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:51,262

Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

375
00:33:51,705 --> 00:33:52,933

- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

376
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,132

Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

377
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,765

- I have it.
- Press Control "l".

378
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:58,276

- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter."

379
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:00,074

Come over here and button me up.

380
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,310

Okay. All right.

381
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:05,715

Every other hex bolt.

382
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,913

- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

383
00:34:08,022 --> 00:34:09,387

- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

384
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:14,123

Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

385
00:34:14,228 --> 00:34:15,923

We need more time.

386
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:18,131

Hey,

387
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:22,231

- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

388
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,335

Stick to the plan!

389
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:27,501

Yinsen!

390
00:37:20,214 --> 00:37:22,648

- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

391
00:37:37,765 --> 00:37:38,891

Stark.

392
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:42,293

Come on. We got to go.

393
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,937

Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

394
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,940

This was always the plan, Stark.

395
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:50,535

Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

396
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,979

My family is dead.

397
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:57,045

I'm going to see them now, Stark.

398
00:37:59,553 --> 00:38:00,952

It's okay.

399
00:38:03,057 --> 00:38:06,026

I want this. I want this.

400
00:38:12,066 --> 00:38:13,966

Thank you for saving me.

401
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:19,428

Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

402
00:38:58,512 --> 00:38:59,479

My turn.

403
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:44,072

Not bad.

404
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,380

Hey!

405
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:41,872

How was the "fun-vee"?

406
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,577

Next time, you ride with me, okay?

407
00:42:17,678 --> 00:42:19,407

Watch it, coming up here.

408
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:24,509

Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

409
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:36,160

Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

410
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:40,825

- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

411
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,694

Where to, sir?

412
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:45,396

- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

413
00:42:45,505 --> 00:42:46,563

No? Tony, you have to

414
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:47,662

- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

415
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,503

- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

416
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,236

I've been in captivity for three months.

417
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:55,076

There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

418
00:42:55,182 --> 00:42:56,149

- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

419
00:42:56,249 --> 00:42:58,649

...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

420
00:42:58,752 --> 00:42:59,946

- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

421
00:43:00,053 --> 00:43:02,578

- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

422
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:16,797

Look at this!

423
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:19,865

Tony.

424
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:25,073

- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

425
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:26,543

Look at you!

426
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:29,713

- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

427
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,250

- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

428
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:38,019

Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

429
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,897

- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

430
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,226

Can I speak to you for a moment?

431
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,928

I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

432
00:43:50,037 --> 00:43:51,334

I'm not a reporter.

433
00:43:51,438 --> 00:43:52,837

I'm agent Phil Coulson,

434
00:43:52,939 --> 00:43:54,668

with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

435
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:56,367

and Logistics Division.

436
00:43:56,476 --> 00:43:59,172

- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

437
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:03,716

You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

438
00:44:03,817 --> 00:44:07,446

We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

439
00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:11,217

We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

440
00:44:11,324 --> 00:44:14,555

- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

441
00:44:19,433 --> 00:44:21,958

Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

442
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:25,470

Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

443
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,730

A little less formal and...

444
00:44:32,612 --> 00:44:35,308

- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

445
00:44:35,415 --> 00:44:37,440

I don't know what he's up to.

446
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:39,951

- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

447
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,453

I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

448
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:45,418

I never got to say goodbye to my father.

449
00:44:49,262 --> 00:44:50,524

There's questions
that I would have asked him.

450
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,656

I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

451
00:44:55,168 --> 00:44:58,035

If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

452
00:44:58,972 --> 00:45:03,238

Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

453
00:45:07,614 --> 00:45:09,707

I saw young Americans killed

454
00:45:10,617 --> 00:45:14,610

by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

455
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,420

And I saw

456
00:45:18,658 --> 00:45:23,459

that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

457
00:45:23,563 --> 00:45:25,497

- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

458
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,234

What happened over there?

459
00:45:29,136 --> 00:45:32,765

I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

460
00:45:32,873 --> 00:45:37,242

to offer this world than just 
making things that blow up.

461
00:45:37,344 --> 00:45:40,802

And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down

462
00:45:40,914 --> 00:45:44,543

the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International

463
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:48,644

until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

464
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:50,279

I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

465
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,119

What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

466
00:45:52,225 --> 00:45:56,252

and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

467
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:02,398

What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

468
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:05,167

And he's healthier than ever.

469
00:46:05,572 --> 00:46:08,666

We're going to have
a little internal discussion

470
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:11,141

and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

471
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,610

- Where is he?
- He's inside.

472
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,358

Well, that... That went well.

473
00:46:29,462 --> 00:46:31,862

Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

474
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:34,263

Your head? What about my head?

475
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:37,359

What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

476
00:46:37,537 --> 00:46:40,529

- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

477
00:46:40,974 --> 00:46:41,941

Yep.

478
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:45,540

Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

479
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:48,273

Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

480
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:50,975

That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

481
00:46:51,084 --> 00:46:52,210

It's my name on the side of the building.

482
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,913

And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

483
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,955

Not based on what I saw.

484
00:46:58,225 --> 00:46:59,192

We're not doing a good enough job.

485
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:00,520

We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

486
00:47:00,627 --> 00:47:03,494

Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

487
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:07,762

I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

488
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:12,167

Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

489
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:15,633

Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

490
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:18,836

- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

491
00:47:19,346 --> 00:47:22,577

The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

492
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:25,844

Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

493
00:47:25,952 --> 00:47:27,078

Maybe.

494
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:30,114

Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

495
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:32,714

- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

496
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:37,590

Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

497
00:47:37,697 --> 00:47:40,894

- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

498
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:43,299

- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

499
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:53,212

- Okay.
- Okay?

500
00:47:56,516 --> 00:47:57,744

It works.

501
00:48:01,821 --> 00:48:05,985

Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

502
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:09,323

There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

503
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,828

like your father and I.

504
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,693

I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

505
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,357

- But if I had...
- Tony.

506
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:17,459

Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

507
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,266

- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

508
00:48:20,907 --> 00:48:23,034

You gotta let me handle this.

509
00:48:23,143 --> 00:48:25,543

We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

510
00:48:25,645 --> 00:48:27,442

We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

511
00:48:27,547 --> 00:48:30,778

I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

512
00:48:31,084 --> 00:48:32,813

Stark Industries!

513
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:35,752

I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

514
00:48:35,855 --> 00:48:36,981

Sell, sell, sell!

515
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:39,191

Abandon ship!

516
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:42,625

Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

517
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,933

Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!

518
00:48:50,603 --> 00:48:54,505

Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

519
00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:57,844

Pepper. How big are your hands?

520
00:48:58,411 --> 00:49:00,606

- What?
- How big are your hands?

521
00:49:00,714 --> 00:49:03,581

- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

522
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,014

Hey.

523
00:49:14,094 --> 00:49:16,585

Let's see them. Show me your hands.

524
00:49:16,696 --> 00:49:17,663

Let's see them.

525
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:20,089

Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

526
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:23,558

I just need your help for a sec.

527
00:49:24,404 --> 00:49:26,565

Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

528
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:29,198

It was. It is now an antique.

529
00:49:30,043 --> 00:49:32,807

This is what will be keeping me 
alive for the foreseeable future.

530
00:49:32,912 --> 00:49:37,508

I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

531
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:40,548

- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

532
00:49:40,653 --> 00:49:43,986

There's an exposed wire
under this device.

533
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:47,184

And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

534
00:49:47,293 --> 00:49:48,920

It's fine.

535
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:51,763

- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

536
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:53,628

- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

537
00:49:53,733 --> 00:49:57,999

I want you to reach in, and you're 
just gonna gently lift the wire out.

538
00:49:58,838 --> 00:50:00,863

- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

539
00:50:00,974 --> 00:50:02,601

It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

540
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:04,040

the socket wall or it goes "beep."

541
00:50:04,144 --> 00:50:06,612

- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

542
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:10,706

- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

543
00:50:12,585 --> 00:50:15,053

You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

544
00:50:15,155 --> 00:50:19,182

No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

545
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:22,784

trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

546
00:50:24,097 --> 00:50:26,031

Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

547
00:50:26,132 --> 00:50:28,794

- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

548
00:50:28,902 --> 00:50:29,994

Okay.

549
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,932

Oh, there's pus!

550
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:40,638

It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

551
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:42,647

- not from my body.
- It smells!

552
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:44,239

Yeah, it does.

553
00:50:44,651 --> 00:50:47,313

The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

554
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,512

- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

555
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:51,522

Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

556
00:50:51,624 --> 00:50:52,591

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

557
00:50:52,692 --> 00:50:54,023

That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

558
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:56,254

Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

559
00:50:56,362 --> 00:50:59,297

There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

560
00:50:59,399 --> 00:51:00,525

- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

561
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:02,760

Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

562
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:03,858

What's wrong?

563
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,301

Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

564
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:06,667

'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

565
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:09,537

- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

566
00:51:09,642 --> 00:51:11,610

- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

567
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:13,742

- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

568
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:14,814

- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

569
00:51:14,914 --> 00:51:17,542

- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

570
00:51:18,084 --> 00:51:22,180

Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

571
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,784

Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

572
00:51:30,997 --> 00:51:32,021

Nice.

573
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,361

- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

574
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:35,695

You okay?

575
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,037

Don't ever, ever, ever,

576
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,108

ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

577
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:45,302

I don't have anyone but you.

578
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:51,951

Anyway...

579
00:51:57,857 --> 00:52:00,758

- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

580
00:52:01,594 --> 00:52:02,925

Destroy it.

581
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:04,963

Incinerate it.

582
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:07,257

You don't want to keep it?

583
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:11,497

Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

584
00:52:12,071 --> 00:52:15,768

- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

585
00:52:16,476 --> 00:52:18,205

Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

586
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:20,211

What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

587
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:23,476

That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

588
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:26,484

Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

589
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:36,924

The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

590
00:52:37,263 --> 00:52:39,356

I'll tell you, in my experience,

591
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:44,198

no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

592
00:52:44,604 --> 00:52:45,832

his insight,

593
00:52:45,939 --> 00:52:48,931

that ability to look into a 
situation beyond the obvious

594
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:52,637

and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

595
00:52:52,745 --> 00:52:55,737

Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

596
00:52:55,848 --> 00:52:57,816

Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

597
00:52:57,917 --> 00:52:59,817

- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

598
00:52:59,919 --> 00:53:01,750

you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

599
00:53:01,854 --> 00:53:04,448

at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

600
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,819

- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

601
00:53:05,925 --> 00:53:07,290

- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

602
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,451

- Was it lvan?
- Don't do that.

603
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:09,789

They'll believe it. Don't do that.

604
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,022

- Okay.
- Don't do that.

605
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,065

- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

606
00:53:17,003 --> 00:53:18,664

- I'm surprised.
- Why?

607
00:53:18,771 --> 00:53:21,467

I swear, I didn't expect to see 
you walking around so soon.

608
00:53:21,641 --> 00:53:23,438

I'm doing a little better than walking.

609
00:53:23,543 --> 00:53:24,976

- Really?
- Yeah.

610
00:53:25,712 --> 00:53:28,306

Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

611
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:31,415

I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

612
00:53:32,685 --> 00:53:35,119

You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

613
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:38,223

'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

614
00:53:38,324 --> 00:53:39,882

that was a doozy.

615
00:53:40,293 --> 00:53:44,787

This is not for the military. 
I'm not... It's different.

616
00:53:44,897 --> 00:53:47,525

What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

617
00:53:47,634 --> 00:53:49,033

- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

618
00:53:49,135 --> 00:53:53,003

What you need is time
to get your mind right.

619
00:53:54,907 --> 00:53:56,431

- I'm serious.
- Okay.

620
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,572

It's nice seeing you, Tony.

621
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:02,841

Thanks.

622
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:14,491

- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.

623
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:18,662

I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark Two.

624
00:54:19,866 --> 00:54:23,529

Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?

625
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,236

Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

626
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:29,137

Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

627
00:54:29,242 --> 00:54:31,938

Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

628
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:38,975

I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

629
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:43,622

Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

630
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:29,595

Next. Up.

631
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:33,136

Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

632
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:35,298

Stay put. Nice.

633
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:40,943

You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

634
00:55:41,447 --> 00:55:43,574

Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

635
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:51,650

Up.

636
00:55:52,525 --> 00:55:54,322

Screw it. Don't even move.

637
00:55:54,427 --> 00:55:57,453

You are a tragedy.

638
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,900

Okay, let's do this right.

639
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,408

Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

640
00:56:16,215 --> 00:56:18,376

Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

641
00:56:18,484 --> 00:56:19,883

You, roll it.

642
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:25,747

Okay. Activate hand controls.

643
00:56:30,129 --> 00:56:31,255

We're gonna start off nice and easy.

644
00:56:31,364 --> 00:56:34,527

We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

645
00:56:34,634 --> 00:56:35,965

And three,

646
00:56:36,836 --> 00:56:37,825

two,

647
00:56:38,671 --> 00:56:39,763

one.

648
00:57:16,876 --> 00:57:19,174

Up two. All right, set that.

649
00:57:19,278 --> 00:57:21,644

I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

650
00:57:21,747 --> 00:57:23,578

Yeah, everything's... What?

651
00:57:23,683 --> 00:57:24,809

- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

652
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:26,908

- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

653
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,614

Okay.

654
00:57:29,422 --> 00:57:31,219

I thought you said you 
were done making weapons.

655
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:32,291

It is.

656
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:36,352

This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

657
00:57:40,433 --> 00:57:41,627

I didn't expect that.

658
00:57:46,973 --> 00:57:48,338

How'd it go?

659
00:57:50,643 --> 00:57:52,270

It went that bad, huh?

660
00:57:52,378 --> 00:57:55,006

Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

661
00:57:55,114 --> 00:57:58,982

- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

662
00:57:59,085 --> 00:58:01,952

It would have gone better
if you were there.

663
00:58:02,221 --> 00:58:03,745

You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

664
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:08,350

- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

665
00:58:09,462 --> 00:58:13,592

- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

666
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,134

The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

667
00:58:17,236 --> 00:58:18,328

They're filing an injunction.

668
00:58:18,437 --> 00:58:20,462

- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

669
00:58:20,573 --> 00:58:21,767

Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

670
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:22,841

We knew that was gonna happen.

671
00:58:22,942 --> 00:58:25,001

- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

672
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:27,306

We own the controlling 
interest in the company.

673
00:58:27,413 --> 00:58:30,143

Tony, the board has rights, too.

674
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:34,884

They're making the case that 
you and your new direction

675
00:58:34,987 --> 00:58:37,217

- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

676
00:58:37,323 --> 00:58:40,315

That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

677
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:45,128

I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

678
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:46,220

This is great.

679
00:58:46,332 --> 00:58:49,790

- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

680
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:52,063

Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

681
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:55,504

I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

682
00:58:55,608 --> 00:58:57,166

Something to pitch them.

683
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:00,746

Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

684
00:59:00,846 --> 00:59:02,973

- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

685
00:59:03,082 --> 00:59:04,640

- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

686
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,548

- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

687
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:09,484

Go on, here, you can have a piece.

688
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,055

- Take two.
- Thank you.

689
00:59:11,157 --> 00:59:13,022

You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

690
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:14,717

Good night, Obie.

691
00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:20,195

Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

692
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:22,961

Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

693
00:59:23,069 --> 00:59:25,867

and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

694
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:27,803

All right, nice and easy.

695
00:59:27,907 --> 00:59:32,810

Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

696
00:59:34,347 --> 00:59:36,406

And three, two, one.

697
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,249

Okay.

698
00:59:50,596 --> 00:59:52,188

Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

699
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:54,698

'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

700
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,461

Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

701
00:59:56,569 --> 00:59:58,799

And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

702
00:59:58,904 --> 01:00:00,496

Three, two, one.

703
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:19,683

Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

704
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:21,089

Not the car, not the car!

705
01:00:22,461 --> 01:00:23,428

Table!

706
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,636

Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

707
01:00:56,762 --> 01:00:58,252

No!

708
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:01,993

Yeah, I can fly.

709
01:01:06,806 --> 01:01:09,741

- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

710
01:01:09,842 --> 01:01:12,037

- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

711
01:01:12,144 --> 01:01:14,169

Import all preferences
from home interface.

712
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,713

Will do, sir.

713
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:23,677

All right, what do you say?

714
01:01:23,789 --> 01:01:27,247

I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.

715
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:28,985

Can we start the virtual walk-around?

716
01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:32,064

Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

717
01:01:32,164 --> 01:01:33,461

Do a check on control surfaces.

718
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:35,056

As you wish.

719
01:01:56,989 --> 01:01:59,514

Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

720
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:02,526

Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

721
01:02:02,628 --> 01:02:04,095

Start listening in on ground control.

722
01:02:04,196 --> 01:02:05,254

Sir, there are still terabytes

723
01:02:05,364 --> 01:02:07,958

of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

724
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:11,969

Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

725
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:16,337

Ready? In three, two, one.

726
01:02:39,665 --> 01:02:41,428

Handles like a dream.

727
01:03:09,607 --> 01:03:11,199

All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

728
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:12,708

What's SR-71's record?

729
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:16,576

The altitude record for fixed 
wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.

730
01:03:17,048 --> 01:03:19,676

Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

731
01:03:22,887 --> 01:03:26,482

Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

732
01:03:26,591 --> 01:03:27,649

Keep going!

733
01:03:29,961 --> 01:03:31,258

Higher!

734
01:03:44,942 --> 01:03:49,208

We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

735
01:03:51,983 --> 01:03:54,315

Come on, we got to break the ice!

736
01:04:29,587 --> 01:04:30,815

Kill power.

737
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:58,438

Notes. Main transducer feels 
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

738
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:02,944

Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

739
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:05,241

A very astute observation, sir.

740
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:07,111

Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

741
01:06:07,216 --> 01:06:08,649

we should improve the exosystems.

742
01:06:08,751 --> 01:06:11,311

Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

743
01:06:11,421 --> 01:06:14,481

Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

744
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:18,424

That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

745
01:06:18,528 --> 01:06:19,790

- Got it?
- Yes.

746
01:06:19,896 --> 01:06:22,194

Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

747
01:06:22,298 --> 01:06:23,629

Thrill me.

748
01:06:25,034 --> 01:06:29,562

Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,

749
01:06:29,672 --> 01:06:33,904

where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund

750
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:35,568

has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

751
01:06:35,678 --> 01:06:36,906

Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

752
01:06:37,013 --> 01:06:39,504

I have no record of an invitation, sir.

753
01:06:39,615 --> 01:06:41,048

... hasn't been seen in public

754
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:44,847

since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

755
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:47,716

Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress

756
01:06:47,824 --> 01:06:51,419

and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

757
01:06:51,928 --> 01:06:54,658

no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

758
01:06:54,764 --> 01:06:56,891

The render is complete.

759
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,661

A little ostentatious, don't you think?

760
01:06:58,768 --> 01:07:01,794

What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

761
01:07:03,473 --> 01:07:06,067

Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

762
01:07:06,175 --> 01:07:09,042

Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

763
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:14,113

The render is complete.

764
01:07:14,617 --> 01:07:16,482

Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

765
01:07:16,586 --> 01:07:18,144

Commencing automated assembly.

766
01:07:18,254 --> 01:07:21,417

Estimated completion time is five hours.

767
01:07:21,524 --> 01:07:22,684

Don't wait up for me, honey.

768
01:07:46,849 --> 01:07:50,580

Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

769
01:07:50,686 --> 01:07:54,417

is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

770
01:07:57,093 --> 01:07:59,584

- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

771
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:02,597

You look great, Hef.

772
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:05,764

We're going to have a great quarter.

773
01:08:05,868 --> 01:08:09,599

What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

774
01:08:09,705 --> 01:08:13,869

Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

775
01:08:13,976 --> 01:08:15,705

I'll see you inside.

776
01:08:16,312 --> 01:08:19,577

Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

777
01:08:19,682 --> 01:08:21,377

I think I got the board
right where we want them.

778
01:08:21,484 --> 01:08:25,045

You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

779
01:08:29,592 --> 01:08:33,119

- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

780
01:08:33,863 --> 01:08:35,592

- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

781
01:08:36,099 --> 01:08:38,294

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

782
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:41,700

Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

783
01:08:41,804 --> 01:08:43,431

God, you need a new name for that.

784
01:08:43,539 --> 01:08:45,473

Yeah, I hear that a lot.

785
01:08:46,309 --> 01:08:50,075

Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

786
01:08:50,179 --> 01:08:52,147

There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

787
01:08:52,248 --> 01:08:54,113

and time can be a factor
with these things.

788
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:56,208

Let's just put something on the books.

789
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:59,652

How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

790
01:09:00,056 --> 01:09:03,287

Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

791
01:09:03,526 --> 01:09:07,724

Well, I'm going to go to my 
assistant, and we'll make a date.

792
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,257

You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

793
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:13,631

- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

794
01:09:13,736 --> 01:09:15,499

- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

795
01:09:15,605 --> 01:09:17,402

- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

796
01:09:17,507 --> 01:09:19,634

- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

797
01:09:19,742 --> 01:09:20,970

Yes.

798
01:09:21,077 --> 01:09:22,942

- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

799
01:09:23,045 --> 01:09:25,536

- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

800
01:09:35,992 --> 01:09:38,187

Am I making you uncomfortable?

801
01:09:38,628 --> 01:09:43,861

No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

802
01:09:43,966 --> 01:09:47,766

in front of everyone that I work 
with in a dress with no back.

803
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:50,595

- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

804
01:09:50,706 --> 01:09:52,571

But I could fire you if that 
would take the edge off.

805
01:09:52,675 --> 01:09:56,304

I actually don't think that you 
could tie your shoes without me.

806
01:09:56,412 --> 01:09:57,845

- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

807
01:09:57,947 --> 01:10:00,415

What's your Social Security number?

808
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,649

- Five.
- Five?

809
01:10:06,522 --> 01:10:07,784

- Right.
- Right.

810
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:10,222

You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

811
01:10:10,326 --> 01:10:13,489

The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

812
01:10:26,108 --> 01:10:29,134

- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

813
01:10:31,113 --> 01:10:33,013

- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

814
01:10:33,115 --> 01:10:35,913

It was totally not harmless, by the way.

815
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:37,414

We're dancing. No one's even watching.

816
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,283

Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

817
01:10:39,388 --> 01:10:42,516

I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

818
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:45,992

No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

819
01:10:46,095 --> 01:10:48,893

And everybody knows
exactly who you are

820
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:52,195

and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

821
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:54,667

But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

822
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:56,738

- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

823
01:10:56,839 --> 01:10:59,672

Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

824
01:10:59,775 --> 01:11:01,675

- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

825
01:11:01,777 --> 01:11:05,543

and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

826
01:11:05,648 --> 01:11:08,378

dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

827
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:25,232

- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

828
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:29,537

- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

829
01:11:29,639 --> 01:11:34,303

Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

830
01:11:35,211 --> 01:11:38,237

Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

831
01:11:38,347 --> 01:11:40,474

Make one of them dirty, will you?

832
01:11:45,154 --> 01:11:47,714

Wow. Tony Stark.

833
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,388

- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

834
01:11:54,463 --> 01:11:54,630

- Carrie.
- Christine.

835
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:55,460

- Carrie.
- Christine.

836
01:11:55,564 --> 01:11:56,531

That's right.

837
01:11:56,632 --> 01:11:59,294

You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

838
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:00,767

Can I at least get a reaction from you?

839
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:03,304

Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

840
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:04,737

'Cause I was referring
to your company's

841
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,171

involvement in this latest atrocity.

842
01:12:06,275 --> 01:12:08,800

Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

843
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:11,243

I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

844
01:12:11,347 --> 01:12:13,713

I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

845
01:12:13,816 --> 01:12:16,114

Is this what you call accountability?

846
01:12:16,218 --> 01:12:18,914

It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

847
01:12:30,499 --> 01:12:32,899

- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

848
01:12:33,402 --> 01:12:35,393

- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

849
01:12:35,504 --> 01:12:37,438

Well, I'm not my company.

850
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:41,805

- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

851
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:43,242

- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

852
01:12:43,346 --> 01:12:46,645

- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

853
01:12:46,749 --> 01:12:48,580

when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

854
01:12:48,684 --> 01:12:50,049

"This is how we do business."

855
01:12:50,152 --> 01:12:53,315

If we're double-dealing 
under the table... Are we?

856
01:12:53,789 --> 01:12:55,882

Tony, your picture, please!

857
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,618

Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

858
01:13:03,432 --> 01:13:06,526

Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

859
01:13:07,303 --> 01:13:10,534

I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

860
01:13:13,008 --> 01:13:15,704

It was the only way I could protect you.

861
01:13:18,114 --> 01:13:19,308

No. No.

862
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:31,656

The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

863
01:13:31,761 --> 01:13:35,424

as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

864
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:38,532

Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

865
01:13:38,634 --> 01:13:40,329

have been driven from their homes,

866
01:13:40,436 --> 01:13:44,668

displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.

867
01:13:45,007 --> 01:13:47,999

Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

868
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,874

they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

869
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:54,814

or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

870
01:13:59,622 --> 01:14:02,989

Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters

871
01:14:03,092 --> 01:14:05,788

referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

872
01:14:06,061 --> 01:14:09,394

As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

873
01:14:09,498 --> 01:14:13,594

A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

874
01:14:13,836 --> 01:14:16,361

With no political will
or international pressure,

875
01:14:16,472 --> 01:14:18,906

there's very little hope
for these refugees.

876
01:14:19,008 --> 01:14:22,273

Around me, a woman begging 
for news on her husband,

877
01:14:22,378 --> 01:14:24,141

who was kidnapped by insurgents,

878
01:14:24,246 --> 01:14:26,771

either forced to join their militia...

879
01:14:27,817 --> 01:14:30,411

Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

880
01:14:30,519 --> 01:14:33,079

holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

881
01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:36,784

A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"

882
01:14:38,427 --> 01:14:40,827

There's very little hope
for these refugees,

883
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:44,764

refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

884
01:18:17,046 --> 01:18:18,741

He's all yours.

885
01:19:17,573 --> 01:19:19,404

What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

886
01:19:19,508 --> 01:19:21,738

No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

887
01:19:21,844 --> 01:19:23,277

Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

888
01:19:23,378 --> 01:19:25,278

Get those monitors up!

889
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:26,677

We got a bogey!

890
01:19:26,782 --> 01:19:28,909

- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

891
01:19:29,017 --> 01:19:30,951

I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

892
01:19:31,053 --> 01:19:32,680

No, it definitely is not us, sir!

893
01:19:32,788 --> 01:19:34,449

- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

894
01:19:34,556 --> 01:19:37,024

I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

895
01:19:37,126 --> 01:19:39,356

- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

896
01:19:39,495 --> 01:19:42,089

Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

897
01:19:48,937 --> 01:19:50,666

We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

898
01:19:50,773 --> 01:19:52,468

with all known databases.
We have nothing.

899
01:19:52,574 --> 01:19:54,769

Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

900
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:56,538

We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

901
01:19:56,645 --> 01:19:58,306

So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

902
01:19:58,413 --> 01:19:59,744

How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

903
01:19:59,848 --> 01:20:01,816

Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

904
01:20:01,917 --> 01:20:04,044

- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

905
01:20:04,219 --> 01:20:06,517

We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

906
01:20:06,622 --> 01:20:08,419

Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

907
01:20:10,993 --> 01:20:13,928

- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

908
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:19,296

- Hello?
- Tony?

909
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:21,096

- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.

910
01:20:21,403 --> 01:20:23,428

- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.

911
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:26,406

- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

912
01:20:26,508 --> 01:20:29,944

- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

913
01:20:30,045 --> 01:20:31,410

It's funny how that works, huh?

914
01:20:31,513 --> 01:20:34,880

Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

915
01:20:34,983 --> 01:20:36,610

a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

916
01:20:36,718 --> 01:20:38,345

Well, that's a hot spot.

917
01:20:38,453 --> 01:20:40,921

Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

918
01:20:41,023 --> 01:20:42,081

Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

919
01:20:42,191 --> 01:20:43,385

I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.

920
01:20:43,492 --> 01:20:45,255

- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving

921
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,123

to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

922
01:20:47,229 --> 01:20:49,561

You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

923
01:20:49,665 --> 01:20:51,132

- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!

924
01:20:51,233 --> 01:20:53,963

- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

925
01:20:54,069 --> 01:20:57,436

right now, and it's about to 
be blown to kingdom come.

926
01:20:58,173 --> 01:20:59,868

That's my exit.

927
01:21:04,646 --> 01:21:08,047

Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.

928
01:21:08,283 --> 01:21:09,716

Whiplash One, what is it?

929
01:21:09,818 --> 01:21:11,115

I've got no idea.

930
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:13,552

- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.

931
01:21:13,655 --> 01:21:14,679

Then you are clear to engage.

932
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:17,725

Hit it.

933
01:21:22,598 --> 01:21:25,567

That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!

934
01:21:29,605 --> 01:21:31,573

- Inbound missile.
- Flares!

935
01:21:34,643 --> 01:21:37,203

Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

936
01:21:51,526 --> 01:21:52,720

Deploy flaps!

937
01:21:53,962 --> 01:21:55,156

Holy!

938
01:21:55,264 --> 01:21:56,822

That thing just jumped 
off the radar, sir.

939
01:21:56,932 --> 01:21:58,456

The sat visual has been lost.

940
01:21:58,567 --> 01:22:00,228

No way that's a UAV.

941
01:22:00,335 --> 01:22:01,427

What is it?

942
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:03,094

I can't see anything.

943
01:22:03,205 --> 01:22:05,639

Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

944
01:22:06,174 --> 01:22:08,734

I think bogey's been handled, sir.

945
01:22:18,153 --> 01:22:19,814

- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

946
01:22:19,922 --> 01:22:21,583

- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

947
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:22,952

You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

948
01:22:23,058 --> 01:22:24,525

No, see, this isn't a game.

949
01:22:24,626 --> 01:22:27,925

You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

950
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,930

- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

951
01:22:30,032 --> 01:22:32,796

I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

952
01:22:32,935 --> 01:22:35,301

Rhodey, you got anything for me?

953
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:39,872

- Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.

954
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:43,236

On your belly!

955
01:22:43,345 --> 01:22:45,210

It looks like a man!

956
01:22:45,447 --> 01:22:48,075

Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

957
01:22:56,158 --> 01:22:57,284

I'm hit! I'm hit!

958
01:22:57,392 --> 01:22:59,656

It's confirmed. He has been hit.

959
01:23:03,832 --> 01:23:05,800

Punch out! Punch out!

960
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,969

Whiplash One down.

961
01:23:14,076 --> 01:23:15,600

Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

962
01:23:15,711 --> 01:23:17,941

Negative! No chute, no chute!

963
01:23:23,485 --> 01:23:24,850

My chute's jammed!

964
01:23:30,892 --> 01:23:33,224

Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

965
01:23:33,328 --> 01:23:35,922

Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

966
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,297

Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

967
01:23:40,402 --> 01:23:42,461

- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

968
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:43,902

inside a legal no fly zone!

969
01:23:44,006 --> 01:23:46,304

Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

970
01:23:46,408 --> 01:23:48,774

You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

971
01:23:48,877 --> 01:23:50,208

Keep going!

972
01:23:57,853 --> 01:23:59,844

Good chute! Good chute!

973
01:24:07,496 --> 01:24:10,329

- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

974
01:24:10,432 --> 01:24:12,992

Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

975
01:24:13,835 --> 01:24:15,234

You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

976
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:19,473

Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

977
01:24:19,574 --> 01:24:21,132

Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

978
01:24:21,243 --> 01:24:24,110

No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

979
01:24:24,279 --> 01:24:25,803

Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

980
01:24:25,914 --> 01:24:28,405

Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

981
01:24:28,517 --> 01:24:30,212

It's not that simple.

982
01:24:31,053 --> 01:24:32,850

An unfortunate training exercise

983
01:24:32,954 --> 01:24:35,821

involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

984
01:24:36,591 --> 01:24:39,958

I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

985
01:24:40,062 --> 01:24:43,964

As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,

986
01:24:44,066 --> 01:24:47,558

it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

987
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:51,765

but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

988
01:24:53,842 --> 01:24:54,900

Hey!

989
01:24:56,845 --> 01:24:58,676

It is a tight fit, sir.

990
01:24:59,714 --> 01:25:02,581

Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

991
01:25:02,684 --> 01:25:04,584

Be gentle. This is my first time.

992
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,284

I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

993
01:25:09,591 --> 01:25:13,288

- I really should be able to...
- Please, try not to move, sir.

994
01:25:14,896 --> 01:25:17,160

What's going on here?

995
01:25:21,736 --> 01:25:25,763

Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

996
01:25:26,341 --> 01:25:28,206

Are those bullet holes?

997
01:25:55,704 --> 01:25:56,898

Welcome.

998
01:26:00,308 --> 01:26:02,367

Compliments of Tony Stark.

999
01:26:03,345 --> 01:26:06,974

If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1000
01:26:07,082 --> 01:26:09,141

You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1001
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:10,980

Show me the weapon.

1002
01:26:12,254 --> 01:26:15,690

Come. Leave your guards outside.

1003
01:26:32,507 --> 01:26:34,998

His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1004
01:26:37,712 --> 01:26:39,646

So this is how he did it.

1005
01:26:40,015 --> 01:26:42,483

This is only a first, crude effort.

1006
01:26:42,717 --> 01:26:44,981

Stark has perfected his design.

1007
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:47,921

He has made a masterpiece of death.

1008
01:26:48,623 --> 01:26:51,751

A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1009
01:26:53,395 --> 01:26:55,693

And you dream of Stark's throne.

1010
01:26:57,532 --> 01:26:59,727

We have a common enemy.

1011
01:27:04,072 --> 01:27:06,006

If we are still in business,

1012
01:27:08,577 --> 01:27:10,738

I will give you these designs

1013
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,247

as a gift.

1014
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:16,315

And in turn,

1015
01:27:18,019 --> 01:27:23,082

I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1016
01:27:40,075 --> 01:27:41,406

Technology.

1017
01:27:43,311 --> 01:27:46,803

It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1018
01:27:48,049 --> 01:27:51,177

Don't worry. It'll only 
last for 15 minutes.

1019
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:54,820

That's the least of your problems.

1020
01:28:00,095 --> 01:28:02,689

Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

1021
01:28:04,366 --> 01:28:06,357

All right, let's finish up here.

1022
01:28:10,338 --> 01:28:13,273

Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1023
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:16,867

and I'm going to want this data 
masked. Recruit our top engineers.

1024
01:28:16,978 --> 01:28:18,843

I want a prototype right away.

1025
01:28:27,055 --> 01:28:30,183

Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1026
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:32,487

I need you to go to my office.

1027
01:28:33,028 --> 01:28:35,428

You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1028
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:38,124

the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1029
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:39,791

This'll get you in.

1030
01:28:39,901 --> 01:28:41,459

It's probably under Executive Files.

1031
01:28:41,569 --> 01:28:43,935

If not, they put it on a ghost 
drive, in which case you need

1032
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:46,701

to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1033
01:28:47,008 --> 01:28:49,476

And what do you plan to do 
with this information if I 
bring it back here?

1034
01:28:49,577 --> 01:28:50,601

Same drill.

1035
01:28:50,712 --> 01:28:52,703

They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1036
01:28:52,814 --> 01:28:55,874

I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1037
01:28:56,851 --> 01:28:57,875

Tony,

1038
01:29:00,221 --> 01:29:02,086

you know that
I would help you with anything,

1039
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:06,149

but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1040
01:29:06,261 --> 01:29:09,822

There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1041
01:29:10,131 --> 01:29:13,294

There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1042
01:29:14,469 --> 01:29:17,495

There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1043
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,071

Is that so?

1044
01:29:22,277 --> 01:29:23,744

Well, then, I quit.

1045
01:29:26,848 --> 01:29:28,440

You stood by my side all these years

1046
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:31,348

while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1047
01:29:31,686 --> 01:29:33,517

And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1048
01:29:33,621 --> 01:29:35,418

that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1049
01:29:35,523 --> 01:29:39,960

You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1050
01:29:40,061 --> 01:29:42,029

I shouldn't be alive,

1051
01:29:43,365 --> 01:29:45,458

unless it was for a reason.

1052
01:29:46,334 --> 01:29:48,165

I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1053
01:29:48,703 --> 01:29:51,831

I just finally know what I have to do.

1054
01:29:56,211 --> 01:29:58,975

And I know in my heart that it's right.

1055
01:30:14,729 --> 01:30:17,129

You're all I have, too, you know.

1056
01:31:26,601 --> 01:31:31,368

Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1057
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:48,619

You did not tell us that the 
target you paid us to kill 
was the great Tony Stark.

1058
01:31:48,723 --> 01:31:50,247

- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.

1059
01:31:50,358 --> 01:31:53,054

... your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1060
01:31:53,161 --> 01:31:55,823

The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1061
01:31:59,868 --> 01:32:04,237

So, what are we going to do about this?

1062
01:32:16,251 --> 01:32:19,516

I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1063
01:32:27,262 --> 01:32:30,925

Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1064
01:32:52,587 --> 01:32:56,956

I was so happy when he came home.

1065
01:32:57,058 --> 01:32:59,822

It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1066
01:33:02,897 --> 01:33:04,831

Now I realize,

1067
01:33:07,168 --> 01:33:10,399

well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1068
01:33:12,173 --> 01:33:14,835

He left a part of himself in that cave.

1069
01:33:17,645 --> 01:33:19,203

Breaks my heart.

1070
01:33:21,549 --> 01:33:25,485

Well, he's a complicated person.

1071
01:33:28,222 --> 01:33:31,589

He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1072
01:33:37,932 --> 01:33:40,662

You are a very rare woman.

1073
01:33:43,204 --> 01:33:45,331

Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1074
01:33:48,109 --> 01:33:50,077

Thank you. Thanks.

1075
01:33:52,113 --> 01:33:54,104

I'd better get back there.

1076
01:33:59,621 --> 01:34:01,612

Is that today's paper?

1077
01:34:03,291 --> 01:34:04,315

Yes.

1078
01:34:05,126 --> 01:34:06,491

Do you mind?

1079
01:34:07,128 --> 01:34:08,925

- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1080
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:10,327

Of course.

1081
01:34:13,835 --> 01:34:15,132

Take care.

1082
01:34:39,327 --> 01:34:42,194

Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1083
01:34:42,296 --> 01:34:43,786

Nope, right now. Come with me.

1084
01:34:43,898 --> 01:34:44,990

- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1085
01:34:45,099 --> 01:34:46,862

- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1086
01:34:48,069 --> 01:34:50,230

I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1087
01:34:51,806 --> 01:34:54,604

Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1088
01:34:55,009 --> 01:34:58,501

Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1089
01:34:58,746 --> 01:35:01,408

Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

1090
01:35:01,516 --> 01:35:03,746

what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1091
01:35:03,851 --> 01:35:05,512

- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1092
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:09,420

Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1093
01:35:09,657 --> 01:35:12,785

- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1094
01:35:12,894 --> 01:35:18,855

William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1095
01:35:18,966 --> 01:35:22,925

Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1096
01:35:23,037 --> 01:35:29,601

Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1097
01:35:31,846 --> 01:35:34,872

Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1098
01:35:51,032 --> 01:35:51,999

Tony?

1099
01:35:54,769 --> 01:35:58,034

Tony, are you there? Hello?

1100
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:00,834

Breathe.

1101
01:36:02,043 --> 01:36:04,739

Easy, easy.

1102
01:36:06,848 --> 01:36:09,112

You remember this one, right?

1103
01:36:10,852 --> 01:36:13,150

It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1104
01:36:13,254 --> 01:36:17,350

There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1105
01:36:19,727 --> 01:36:20,955

Tony.

1106
01:36:23,297 --> 01:36:27,631

When I ordered the hit on you,

1107
01:36:30,271 --> 01:36:32,739

I worried that I was

1108
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:37,801

killing the golden goose.

1109
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:42,911

But, you see, it was just

1110
01:36:44,285 --> 01:36:46,515

fate that you survived that.

1111
01:36:51,626 --> 01:36:55,460

You had one last golden egg to give.

1112
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:04,934

Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1113
01:37:08,876 --> 01:37:13,973

Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1114
01:37:14,081 --> 01:37:18,313

Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1115
01:37:28,329 --> 01:37:29,956

Oh, it's beautiful.

1116
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,401

Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1117
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:42,174

What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1118
01:37:43,578 --> 01:37:45,307

This is your legacy.

1119
01:37:47,882 --> 01:37:53,047

A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1120
01:37:56,290 --> 01:37:59,987

Weapons that will help steer 
the world back on course,

1121
01:38:00,094 --> 01:38:02,324

put the balance of power in our hands.

1122
01:38:03,931 --> 01:38:05,523

The right hands.

1123
01:38:08,703 --> 01:38:13,197

I wish you could've seen my prototype.

1124
01:38:14,642 --> 01:38:16,109

It's not as...

1125
01:38:17,478 --> 01:38:20,447

Well, not as conservative as yours.

1126
01:38:22,516 --> 01:38:25,314

Too bad you had to involve 
Pepper in this.

1127
01:38:25,786 --> 01:38:28,346

I would have preferred that she lived.

1128
01:38:41,402 --> 01:38:43,666

What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1129
01:38:43,771 --> 01:38:46,365

Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1130
01:38:47,642 --> 01:38:48,904

Okay, where's Tony now?

1131
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:50,705

I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1132
01:38:50,811 --> 01:38:52,938

Please go over there and 
make sure everything's okay.

1133
01:38:53,047 --> 01:38:55,607

Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1134
01:40:01,983 --> 01:40:03,245

Good boy.

1135
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:44,148

Tony?

1136
01:40:46,827 --> 01:40:47,885

Tony?

1137
01:40:49,697 --> 01:40:50,789

Tony?

1138
01:40:52,933 --> 01:40:54,025

Tony?

1139
01:40:56,737 --> 01:40:57,795

Tony!

1140
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:02,271

Tony! You okay?

1141
01:41:02,676 --> 01:41:06,271

- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

1142
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:08,678

They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1143
01:41:08,849 --> 01:41:10,908

That's not going to be enough.

1144
01:41:34,775 --> 01:41:40,736

Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1145
01:41:49,790 --> 01:41:52,452

My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1146
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,687

Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1147
01:41:54,795 --> 01:41:56,194

It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1148
01:41:56,297 --> 01:41:58,993

You might want to take
a few steps back.

1149
01:42:17,618 --> 01:42:20,109

That's the coolest thing 
I've ever seen.

1150
01:42:20,221 --> 01:42:22,985

Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1151
01:42:29,697 --> 01:42:32,029

You need me to do anything else?

1152
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:34,429

Keep the skies clear.

1153
01:42:39,607 --> 01:42:40,835

Damn!

1154
01:42:48,949 --> 01:42:50,541

Next time, baby.

1155
01:43:20,714 --> 01:43:24,047

Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1156
01:43:24,685 --> 01:43:26,653

I thought it'd be bigger.

1157
01:44:23,410 --> 01:44:25,378

How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is going to hold up?

1158
01:44:25,479 --> 01:44:27,777

The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1159
01:44:27,881 --> 01:44:30,543

That chest piece was never 
designed for sustained flight.

1160
01:44:30,651 --> 01:44:32,141

Keep me posted.

1161
01:44:33,954 --> 01:44:34,921

Pepper!

1162
01:44:35,022 --> 01:44:38,014

- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

1163
01:44:38,125 --> 01:44:40,025

- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.

1164
01:44:40,127 --> 01:44:41,890

- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.

1165
01:44:41,996 --> 01:44:43,429

Get out of there right now!

1166
01:44:55,309 --> 01:44:57,607

Where do you think you're going?

1167
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:06,119

Your services are no longer required.

1168
01:45:06,353 --> 01:45:07,786

Stane!

1169
01:45:33,013 --> 01:45:34,674

I love this suit!

1170
01:45:34,782 --> 01:45:37,979

- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.

1171
01:45:39,553 --> 01:45:41,578

Divert power to chest RT.

1172
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:52,424

Power reduced to 19%.

1173
01:46:00,307 --> 01:46:01,365

Lady!

1174
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:05,301

No, no, no, no, no, no!

1175
01:46:27,401 --> 01:46:30,336

For 30 years, I've 
been holding you up!

1176
01:46:34,842 --> 01:46:37,242

I built this company from nothing!

1177
01:46:39,546 --> 01:46:42,071

Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1178
01:46:48,355 --> 01:46:49,947

Least of all you!

1179
01:47:00,334 --> 01:47:03,565

Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

1180
01:47:04,171 --> 01:47:06,867

I've made some upgrades of my own!

1181
01:47:15,249 --> 01:47:17,183

Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1182
01:47:17,284 --> 01:47:18,945

Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1183
01:47:19,052 --> 01:47:21,316

With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1184
01:47:21,422 --> 01:47:23,549

I know the math! Do it!

1185
01:47:31,865 --> 01:47:34,163

Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1186
01:47:34,268 --> 01:47:36,862

Get me Major Allen. 
Scramble the jets!

1187
01:47:39,606 --> 01:47:42,575

Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1188
01:47:42,676 --> 01:47:43,904

Yes, sir.

1189
01:47:51,885 --> 01:47:53,785

- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!

1190
01:47:57,825 --> 01:47:59,816

- Eleven percent.
- Keep going!

1191
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,693

- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!

1192
01:48:08,802 --> 01:48:10,360

Stop telling me!

1193
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:24,642

You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

1194
01:48:25,252 --> 01:48:27,277

How'd you solve the icing problem?

1195
01:48:27,387 --> 01:48:28,854

Icing problem?

1196
01:48:31,091 --> 01:48:33,423

Might want to look into it.

1197
01:48:45,138 --> 01:48:46,400

Two percent.

1198
01:48:48,575 --> 01:48:51,442

We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1199
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:06,526

- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1200
01:49:06,627 --> 01:49:10,757

I'm almost out of power. 
I've got to get out of this thing. 
I'll be right there.

1201
01:49:10,864 --> 01:49:12,229

Nice try!

1202
01:49:24,845 --> 01:49:28,474

- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1203
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:34,744

Flares!

1204
01:49:43,297 --> 01:49:45,322

Very clever, Tony.

1205
01:49:50,671 --> 01:49:53,139

- Potts?
- Tony!

1206
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:54,207

This isn't working.

1207
01:49:54,308 --> 01:49:56,572

We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1208
01:49:56,677 --> 01:49:59,544

- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

1209
01:49:59,646 --> 01:50:02,080

Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1210
01:50:02,182 --> 01:50:03,581

When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1211
01:50:03,684 --> 01:50:06,244

You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1212
01:50:06,353 --> 01:50:07,718

It's going to fry everything up here.

1213
01:50:09,923 --> 01:50:12,187

Okay. I'm going in now.

1214
01:50:12,292 --> 01:50:15,523

Make sure you wait till I clear 
the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1215
01:50:25,072 --> 01:50:26,835

This looks important!

1216
01:50:47,761 --> 01:50:50,525

I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1217
01:50:50,631 --> 01:50:54,727

but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1218
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:05,478

You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1219
01:51:07,881 --> 01:51:09,974

You'd have made your father proud!

1220
01:51:14,988 --> 01:51:17,456

It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1221
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:38,307

Tony!

1222
01:51:39,546 --> 01:51:41,138

How ironic, Tony!

1223
01:51:42,983 --> 01:51:47,852

Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1224
01:51:48,121 --> 01:51:53,991

- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1225
01:51:57,064 --> 01:52:00,898

- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

1226
01:52:01,001 --> 01:52:04,960

- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

1227
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:09,565

- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1228
01:52:12,713 --> 01:52:14,180

Push it!

1229
01:53:11,772 --> 01:53:13,535

Tony!

1230
01:53:21,982 --> 01:53:24,075

You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

1231
01:53:24,184 --> 01:53:26,448

at Stark Industries last night.

1232
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:31,314

There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1233
01:53:31,458 --> 01:53:34,018

and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1234
01:53:34,795 --> 01:53:37,025

Fortunately, a member of Tony 
Stark's personal security staff...

1235
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:39,030

"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1236
01:53:39,132 --> 01:53:42,761

I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1237
01:53:42,869 --> 01:53:45,497

but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1238
01:53:45,605 --> 01:53:47,197

Here's your alibi.

1239
01:53:48,108 --> 01:53:49,166

Okay.

1240
01:53:49,276 --> 01:53:51,403

- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1241
01:53:51,511 --> 01:53:53,604

We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1242
01:53:53,713 --> 01:53:55,408

and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1243
01:53:55,515 --> 01:53:58,609

See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1244
01:53:58,718 --> 01:54:00,481

alone on the island.

1245
01:54:01,822 --> 01:54:03,084

- That's what happened.
- All right.

1246
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:05,283

Just read it, word for word.

1247
01:54:07,227 --> 01:54:09,218

There's nothing about Stane here.

1248
01:54:09,329 --> 01:54:12,093

That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1249
01:54:12,999 --> 01:54:15,433

Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1250
01:54:15,535 --> 01:54:18,026

But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1251
01:54:18,138 --> 01:54:21,005

He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1252
01:54:21,107 --> 01:54:23,405

This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1253
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:27,469

Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1254
01:54:27,581 --> 01:54:29,811

You've got 90 seconds.

1255
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:34,346

Agent Coulson?

1256
01:54:35,055 --> 01:54:39,515

I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1257
01:54:39,626 --> 01:54:42,527

That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1258
01:54:42,829 --> 01:54:46,162

- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1259
01:54:46,533 --> 01:54:47,659

Right.

1260
01:54:48,668 --> 01:54:52,536

- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

1261
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,903

Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1262
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:56,565

- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1263
01:54:56,676 --> 01:54:59,110

- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1264
01:54:59,212 --> 01:55:03,171

You know, if I were Iron Man, 
I'd have this girlfriend who 
knew my true identity.

1265
01:55:03,283 --> 01:55:05,808

She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1266
01:55:05,919 --> 01:55:08,285

yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1267
01:55:08,388 --> 01:55:12,085

She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1268
01:55:13,827 --> 01:55:14,851

crazy about me.

1269
01:55:14,961 --> 01:55:16,622

Tell me you never think about that night.

1270
01:55:16,730 --> 01:55:18,561

- What night?
- You know.

1271
01:55:21,534 --> 01:55:27,268

Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1272
01:55:28,942 --> 01:55:34,505

and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1273
01:55:34,614 --> 01:55:37,845

and you left me there, by myself?

1274
01:55:39,085 --> 01:55:41,576

Is that the night you're talking about?

1275
01:55:43,790 --> 01:55:44,848

Thought so.

1276
01:55:47,594 --> 01:55:51,325

- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1277
01:55:51,431 --> 01:55:54,923

And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1278
01:55:55,035 --> 01:55:58,061

He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

1279
01:56:02,275 --> 01:56:07,338

Been a while since I was in 
front of you. I figure I'll 
stick to the cards this time.

1280
01:56:09,349 --> 01:56:12,375

There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

1281
01:56:12,485 --> 01:56:13,747

on the freeway and the rooftop...

1282
01:56:13,853 --> 01:56:16,617

I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1283
01:56:16,723 --> 01:56:20,454

that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1284
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,654

- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

1285
01:56:23,763 --> 01:56:27,358

It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

1286
01:56:27,467 --> 01:56:30,698

to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1287
01:56:30,804 --> 01:56:32,396

I never said you were a superhero.

1288
01:56:32,505 --> 01:56:37,807

Didn't? Well, good, because that 
would be outlandish and fantastic.

1289
01:56:39,846 --> 01:56:43,077

I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1290
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:46,585

With this laundry list
of character defects,

1291
01:56:46,686 --> 01:56:48,119

all the mistakes I've made,

1292
01:56:48,221 --> 01:56:51,554

- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.

1293
01:56:51,658 --> 01:56:53,285

Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1294
01:56:55,428 --> 01:56:56,918

The truth is

1295
01:57:03,136 --> 01:57:04,603

I am Iron Man.

1296
02:05:07,854 --> 02:05:09,082

Jarvis!

1297
02:05:09,188 --> 02:05:10,883

Welcome home, sir.

1298
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:19,821

"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1299
02:05:20,199 --> 02:05:23,430

Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1300
02:05:23,536 --> 02:05:25,299

You just don't know it yet.

1301
02:05:25,838 --> 02:05:27,567

Who the hell are you?

1302
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:30,502

Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1303
02:05:32,645 --> 02:05:35,580

I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
